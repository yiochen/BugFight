**BugMeNot**
===================
Overview
-----------
This is the game I made in CodeDay NY 2014. It's a multiplayer Android game. When paired with another phone through bluetooth, you can send your bugs to attack your opponent. You will also be attacked by bugs. You will need to use your most powerful weapon, finger to kill them. Each type of bugs has different abilities. When you use up your HP, you lose the game.
How to Play
--------------
Your power (the yellow bar on the bottom) is accumulating over time. If you don't use it, it refreshes when it reaches maximum(I'm still deciding if I want this feature or not). When the icons of bugs on the bottom light up, you can send a bug to your friend's phone by taping it. Different bugs cost different amount of power. To kill a bug, you just tap it. Last but not least, do not let the bugs reach the end of screen.
